## Definition

**Pragmatic** (/praɡˈmatɪk/) means dealing with things sensibly and realistically, focusing on practical solutions rather than purely theoretical ideas.

---

## Who Are Pragmatic Programmers?

Pragmatic programmers approach problems by looking beyond the immediate challenge. They build sustainable, adaptable software by thinking in broader, more strategic ways.

## Topic 1: It's My Life

- **Philosophy:**  
  Software development is one of the few careers where you have true control. Martin Fowler states, "you can change your organization or change your organization." Bruce Lee reminds us:
  > "I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine."

- **Key Tips:**
  1. **Tip 1: Care About Your Craft**  
     Only invest your time in software development if you truly care about doing it well.
  2. **Tip 2: Think! About Your Work**  
     Avoid the autopilot—regularly critique and appraise your work to maintain high standards.

---

## Topic 2: The Cat Ate My Source Code

- **Taking Responsibility:**  
  Avoid letting the fear of appearing weak hold you back. Own your decisions and actions.

- **Key Tip:**
  3. **Tip 3: Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses**  
     When challenges arise, focus on solutions rather than excuses. If refactoring is necessary, explain its benefits. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when needed.

---

## Topic 3: Software Entropy

- **Concept:**  
  Entropy in software—often referred to as "software rot" or technical debt—is the gradual increase of disorder in a system.

- **Key Tip:**
  5. **Tip 5: Don't Live with Broken Windows**  
     Just as a broken window can lead to urban decay, small defects can snowball into major issues. Address them immediately, or if time is limited, temporarily “board them up” (e.g., comment out code or use placeholder data).

- **Challenge:**  
  Work with your team to identify a few “broken windows” in your project and discuss potential solutions.

---

## Topic 4: Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

- **Approach:**  
  Begin with a tangible solution. Once you demonstrate its potential, encourage further development and improvements.

- **Key Tips:**
  6. **Tip 6: Be a Catalyst for Change**  
     Prevent small issues from escalating by addressing them early.
  7. **Tip 7: Remember the Big Picture**  
     Maintain an awareness of both your immediate tasks and the overall project environment.

---

## Topic 5: Good-Enough Software

- **Quality as a Requirement:**  
  Build the scope and quality of your system into its requirements. Often, great software today is better than perfect software tomorrow.

- **Key Tip:**
  7. **Tip 7: Make Quality a Requirements Issue**  
     Define and incorporate quality standards at the outset of development.

---

## Topic 6: Your Knowledge Portfolio

- **Philosophy:**  
  "An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest." Manage your knowledge like a financial portfolio—diversify, invest regularly, and rebalance as needed.

- **Guidelines:**
  - **Invest Regularly:** Set aside dedicated time for learning new skills.
  - **Diversify:** Broaden your expertise across both technical and non-technical areas.
  - **Manage Risk:** Balance established methods with high-risk, high-reward opportunities.
  - **Buy Low, Sell High:** Learn emerging technologies before they become mainstream.
  - **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly reassess and update your skills.

- **Key Tips:**
  9. **Tip 9: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio**  
     Build a habit of continuous learning.
  9. **Tip 9: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear**  
     Question new information—ask the “Five Why’s,” verify its context, and assess who benefits.

- **Additional Suggestions:**
  - Learn a new language or tool daily.
  - Read a technical book each month.
  - Attend classes and meetups.
  - Stay updated with current technology trends.

## Topic 7: Communicate!

- **Effective Communication:**  
  Clear communication is as essential as writing clean code. Plan your message, understand your audience, and choose the right format for your content.

- **Best Practices:**
  - **Plan Your Message:** Create an outline before communicating.
  - **Know Your Audience:** Tailor your message to their interests and level of detail.
  - **Choose the Right Format:** Whether it’s a report, memo, or informal conversation, adapt your style accordingly.
  - **Engage and Listen:** Encourage feedback and always follow up.

- **Key Tips:**
  10. **Tip 10: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It**  
      Your message is influenced by both content and delivery.
  11. **Tip 11: English is Just Another Programming Language**  
      Use clarity and precision in your communication.
  13. **Tip 13: Build Documentation In, Don’t Bolt It On**  
      Integrate documentation into your development process from the beginning.
